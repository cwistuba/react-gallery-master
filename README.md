# REACT GALLERY MASTER

## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

For this project I created a gallery page to share pictures of things that are important to me. Visitors can click on an image to see a description and use a button to "like" an image.

To practice passing values through `props` in React, I built the gallery using multiple components - an `App`, `GalleryList`, and `GalleryItem`.

- `App` - represents the overall application or site
- `GalleryList` - represents the gallery of images.
- `GalleryItem` - represents a single image in the gallery with the ability to click the image to toggle between image and description as well as the ability to like an image.
